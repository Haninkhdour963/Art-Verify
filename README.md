# Art-Verify
Blockchain-powered digital artwork protection platform on Hedera Hashgraph.

# Art-Verify

**Art-Verify** is a decentralized platform that provides immutable proof of ownership and authenticity for digital artists and creators.  
The platform leverages **Hedera Hashgraph** for secure and fast transactions, **Docker** for containerized deployment, and **IPFS** for decentralized storage of digital artwork.  

Our mission is to empower artists by protecting their creations and enabling transparent proof of provenance.

## Hedera Services Used

-- **Hedera Smart Contracts: For minting and managing digital artwork ownership tokens.

-- **Hedera Tokens: For representing unique digital artwork as tokens (NFT-like).

-- **Hedera Consensus Service (optional): For logging immutable proof of actions on the ledger.

--**Why Hedera?
Hedera offers fast, secure, and low-cost transactions with high throughput and finality, which is ideal for NFT-like digital ownership tracking.

--**Security Notes

Never commit private keys or sensitive credentials to the repository.

Use .env for all secrets and .env.example to show the required environment variables.

Ensure Docker containers are configured to avoid exposing sensitive ports to the public.
