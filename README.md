# Art-Verify
Blockchain-powered digital artwork protection platform on Hedera Hashgraph.

# Art-Verify

**Art-Verify** is a decentralized platform that provides immutable proof of ownership and authenticity for digital artists and creators.  
The platform leverages **Hedera Hashgraph** for secure and fast transactions, **Docker** for containerized deployment, and **IPFS** for decentralized storage of digital artwork.  

Our mission is to empower artists by protecting their creations and enabling transparent proof of provenance.
